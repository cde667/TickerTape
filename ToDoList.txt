0.  Code cleanup:

    - Move some stuff into the detail directory
    - Get the sequencing type to be consistent across all the tape related files.

1.  Promote()

    Take a "backup" tape and make it primary.
    Adjust the listeners, senders / etc... accordingly

2.  Growability

    Make it so I can grow segments in the Synchronizer.  It will create the next segement
    and it will handle it accordingly.  Clients would store the mapped memory in a linked
    list with the idea they would remove the current page from memory when they get to that
    point.  This should keep the memory footprint on a per-process basis minimal.


3.  Counting of the pages in use (expand header)
    Add to the memory header somewhere.  When it goes to 1 (i.e., only the synchronizer)
    the synchronizer can "finalize" it and move it out of memory and onto disk or the 
    like for more perminant storage.

    In general, put some additional useful stuff into the header on the tape.  This is
    currently just a start.


4.  Improve the shared memory stuff; I think its about 90% there...but should be 
    put into a better state.  


5.  Socket cleanup --
    Create a base class that handles much of it.  It's currently a bit of a hack.  I
    wanted to do it this way first, knowing that this would need work later.  I would 
    probably move the parsers into their own class(es), and give the socket as an
    argument.

6.  CMake files --
    Write them.  Need to install CMake on this mac.
