The idea here is that your memory is a tape...it just keeps growing, adding 
in more memory.  In this case, I made it operate off of shared memory and
then added in synchronization with a backup. It's a generic model for
communication.

The test directory contains a sample Reader, Writer and Synchronizer.  
Eventually, they should get moved into an application directory when
they get a bit more mature.
